# Active Tasks
## Algorithms
-------------
### Voxels
* Voxel rendering only draws visible voxels of each type.
* Voxel rendering only draws visible sides of each voxel.
* Voxel texture decoding to draw properly.

### Interaction
* Mouse pos -> Voxel position / unit selection
* Vehicle point-to-point voxel navigation.
* Vehicle angle based on position when near to ramps.

## Coding
---------
* Additional documentation on all existing classes.
* ModelManager class to load in static textured models.
* Minimap
* Basic menus
* 'Player' core game object
* 'Projectile' core game object
* 'Sky' (box) core game object.

## Design
---------
* Menu system
* Network interaction
* AI interaction for single-player games.


## Artistic
-----------
* Unit parts (truck, weapon, sensor)
* Images for each core tech in the tech tree.
* Voxel textures.

## Other
--------
* Better documentation
* More investigation into SF GUI.
* Conversion of Music and Sound managers from AsteroidaGraphica to TemperFine.
